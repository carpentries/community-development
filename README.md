| Calendar for regional events 	| Also, a regional webpage/site that shows an event calendar would be great (something similar to the current one for Africa) especially if the regional pages within the Handbook is replaced with something else.                                                                                                                                                                                                               	| Naoe Tatara   	| pending 	| 
| GH repo for each regional community	| For a local/regional community that is not institution-based one, it would be ideal if the Carpentries could provide a platforms/tools for communication and archive. Topic-box, slack channel, CodiMD and possibility to use Zoom for community call are all very nice already, but it will be even better if the community can have a GH repo under the "carpentries" account! GH repo can be used for many different purposes, but one great thing is the possibility to archive documents etc. such as meeting minutes taken on CodiMD note. If a regional page inside the Carpentries handbook will continue, this repository should be linked from there, too. (Maybe the region page (like https://carpentries.org/regions_nordic/) should also have a link to the region page in the Handbook or the repo directly?)                                                                                                                                                                                                               	| Naoe Tatara   	| pending 	| 
|guides for new community members keen on setting up spaces for local or regional community conversations. 	| The Carpentries already has a go-to process used every time someone reaches out with this request, and it need only be documented to be formalised / clarified for all                                                                                                                                                                                                               	| Serah Njambi Rono   	| pending |
